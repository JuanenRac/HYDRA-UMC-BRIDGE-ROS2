## 1. 🛠️ TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

**HYDRA-UMC-BRIDGE-ROS2** is the bidirectional, high-level coordination boundary between HYDRA-UMC and ROS 2. It maps continuous observation to a topic, immediate inspection to a service, and long-running cell work to a cancellable action. It is not a motor-control node, and it cannot bypass HYDRA-UMC-SERVER, MCU limits, watchdogs or E-STOP.

It belongs to the **External Automation Bridges** family: a set of sibling repositories (CNC, LASER, OPENPNP, PRINTER3D, ROS2) that all speak the same shared safety contract from `HYDRA-UMC-SDK`, so no bridge can invent its own definition of "safe to work".

### Key Features:
* ✅ **Real, dependency-free coordination core:** `coordinator.py`'s `Ros2Coordinator` has zero `rclpy` import — it is deliberately plain Python, testable on any host without a ROS 2 installation. *(implemented, tested in `tests/test_coordinator.py`)*
* ✅ **Real three-way interface mapping:** three fixed class attributes reserve the exact ROS 2 interface kind for each purpose — `/hydra_umc/machine_state` (topic, continuous state), `/hydra_umc/inspect_cell` (service, short inspection), `/hydra_umc/execute_cell_job` (action, cancellable job). *(implemented)*
* ✅ **Real shared safety gate:** every job dispatched through `Ros2Coordinator.dispatch()` is evaluated by `evaluate_job()` from `HYDRA-UMC-SDK`'s `bridge_contract`, the same gate every sibling bridge and HYDRA-UMC-SERVER use; a productive phase requires an `IDLE` external machine and a `READY` HYDRA-UMC cell, while `ABORT` remains requestable during a fault. *(implemented)*
* ✅ **Fail-closed phase routing and static evidence:** productive phases map only to the planned job action, `ABORT` maps to `/hydra_umc/request_safe_stop`, and an unknown future SDK phase is denied. `inspect_interface_plan.py` emits the static schema `1.1` plan — including the real `transient_local` durability QoS the state topic needs (ROS 2's own replacement for ROS 1's latched publisher, researched against design.ros2.org/articles/qos.html) — without importing `rclpy` or contacting DDS. *(implemented, tested)*
* ✅ **Real, partial `rclpy` transport:** `rclpy_transport.py` connects the 2 interfaces with a real, standard ROS 2 message type today — `Ros2SafeStopClient` (a real `std_srvs/Trigger` client) and `Ros2StateSubscriber` (a real `std_msgs/String` subscriber, using the real `transient_local` durability QoS). *(implemented, tested in `tests/test_rclpy_transport.py`)*
* ✅ **Non-mutating build/test:** `build-test.bat`/`.sh` compile the source and run deterministic unit tests without changing version or CHANGELOG. *(implemented, see BUILD & RUN below)*
* 🔜 **Custom `.srv`/`.action` contracts for `inspect_service`/`job_action`** — these have no real standard ROS 2 message type, so a client for them needs this repository to define its own interface package first. *(planned)*

## 3. 🧱 ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN DECISIONS

* **Why `coordinator.py` has zero `rclpy` dependency.** Its own module docstring states this deliberately: it "can be tested on any host and becomes a ROS 2 node only through a separately deployed adapter." This keeps the safety-relevant coordination logic testable in CI without a ROS 2 installation, and lets the adapter be chosen and validated independently, later.
* **Why three distinct interface kinds instead of one generic channel.** `state_topic`, `inspect_service` and `job_action` map to ROS 2's own semantics on purpose: continuous state publication doesn't need request/reply (topic), a quick inspection needs a synchronous answer (service), and cell work needs to be cancellable mid-flight (action) — collapsing these into one channel would lose that distinction.
* **Why `Ros2Coordinator.dispatch()` still funnels every job through the shared `evaluate_job()` gate.** ROS 2 is just another client of the same `bridge_contract` that CNC, LASER, OPENPNP and PRINTER3D use — it gets no special bypass of the IDLE/READY logic that every other bridge and HYDRA-UMC-SERVER enforce.
* **Why `ABORT` stays requestable during a fault.** The gate's productive-phase requirement (`IDLE` + `READY`) is intentionally not applied the same way to an abort request — an operator or a ROS 2 node must always be able to ask for a controlled stop, even mid-fault.
* **Why the `rclpy` adapter and ROS `.msg`/`.srv`/`.action` contracts are not in this repo yet.** Committing to specific message/service/action definitions before a real ROS 2 environment is selected and tested would risk baking in assumptions this local, dependency-free core cannot verify.
* **How this fits the rest of the ecosystem.** BRIDGE-ROS2 sits between ROS 2 nodes and `HYDRA-UMC-SDK` → `HYDRA-UMC-SERVER` → MCU safety — it is a coordination boundary, never a motor-control node, and it cannot bypass HYDRA-UMC-SERVER, MCU limits, watchdogs or E-STOP.

## 4. ⚙️ BUILD & RUN

Requires Python 3.11+. `tools/build_test.py` expects `HYDRA-UMC-SDK` checked out as a sibling directory (`../HYDRA-UMC-SDK`) or pointed at via the `HYDRA_UMC_SDK_ROOT` environment variable.

```bash
# Windows
build-test.bat      # validate only — no version/CHANGELOG change
build.bat            # validate, then bump version + CHANGELOG on success

# Linux/macOS
bash build-test.sh
bash build.sh
```

`build-test` compiles every module under `src/` with `py_compile` and runs the full `unittest` suite (`tests/test_coordinator.py`) — deterministically, with no ROS 2 install, no network and no version/CHANGELOG change. `build` runs that same validation first and, only on success, calls `tools/bump_version.py` to synchronize the version across `pyproject.toml`, `hydra-umc.project.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`. There is no live hardware `run` command yet — that requires a validated ROS 2 deployment.

---

## ✅ Current Status & Next Steps

**Real today:** version `0.0.5`, functional as a dependency-free coordination core (`Ros2Coordinator`) with a deterministic twenty-one-test `unittest` suite covering the coordination core, the MQTT transport and the rclpy transport, fail-closed phase routing, a static `plan-only` interface schema declaring the real `transient_local` durability QoS the state topic needs, a real (lazily-imported) rclpy transport for the 2 interfaces with a real standard ROS 2 message type, and non-mutating build-test scripts wired into CI with an SDK checkout.

**Integration boundary:** this bridge is a coordination boundary only — it is not a motor-control node, and it cannot bypass HYDRA-UMC-SERVER, MCU limits, watchdogs or E-STOP; every dispatched job still passes through the same shared gate every sibling bridge uses.

**Still ahead:** no ROS network, robot or physical actuator has been validated yet — the `rclpy` adapter and concrete ROS `.msg`/`.srv`/`.action` contracts will be introduced only after a real ROS 2 environment is selected and tested.
